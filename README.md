# Summer_Research_2019 (Work with Shelby Kimmel)

* Analyzed the change in the probability distribution of finding the period in a modified Quantum Period Finding problem where there are random insertions or deletions (glitches) of points in the periodic function.
* Developed a robust and efficient algorithm to deal with the glitches. Proved performance guarantee for the simple case of a few glitches. Worked on finding ways to extend the analysis for arbitrary number of glitches. 
* Wrote a numerical simulation using python to analyze the behaviors corresponding to the change in the places of insertions/deletions, and to test out the predictions of the our algorithm and analysis.
